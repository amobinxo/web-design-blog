    <h1>My Web Design Journey</h1>

    <p>I am starting my journey in <span class="highlight">Web Design Technologies</span> this semester and I am excited to share my experience so far. This module has introduced me to the foundations of web development including HTML, JavaScript, PHP, and web hosting.</p>

    <h2>The Puzzle of Coding</h2>
    <p>Coding feels like solving a giant puzzle where every piece has to fit perfectly. At first it can be confusing and exhausting. Understanding HTML elements with opening and closing tags and content was tricky. JavaScript is fascinating because it can turn a static web page into something interactive, but I often cannot sleep until I debug the code and get it right.</p>

    <h2>The Server Side Challenge</h2>
    <p>PHP and the server side are especially challenging. Figuring out how PHP scripts interact with the server and manage databases is complicated. SQL is difficult and connecting files through FTP adds another layer of work. Despite the challenges, I love learning how client and server interact. Seeing how the client side that the user interacts with communicates with the server side where data is stored and processed is like discovering the inner workings of a complex machine.</p>

    <div class="fun-fact">One of my favorite parts of web design is getting to show my personality and creativity through visuals. Designing a website allows me to be creative and expressive, which I really enjoy. Programming itself can feel a lot less creative to me, but being able to combine coding with design keeps the work exciting.</div>

    <h2>Foundations and Learning</h2>
    <p>From Module 1 I learned about the history of the Web, the structure of HTML documents, the role of client-side and server-side scripting, and how web pages communicate using protocols like HTTP. I now understand how web programming is different from general programming because it requires knowledge of client and server scripting, databases, and network communication.</p>

    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
    <p>So far my experience has been a mix of excitement and confusion and I am eager to gain more hands-on practice with HTML, JavaScript, and PHP. I look forward to becoming confident in these tools and creating functional websites that come to life.</p>

    <p>I confirm that I have read and understood the syllabus outline and I am ready to learn open source web technologies this semester.</p>
